I withdrew from classes for the Spring and Summer semester in February. Shortly before I left (I wrote to you about this then) I had an encounter with housing personnel who basically accosted me while I was in the process of having a disruptive panic attack from my generalized anxiety disorder. I ended up later that week in the office of Sheree Gibson, a senior GA Tech housing personnel, who told me that before I reapplied to graduate housing in the Fall (starting this August), I needed to \"go through\" her and approve the application. Her perspective is that I need(ed) (have since received) a formal accommodation for my anxiety disorder through the disability office if I am going to be in that situation potentially dealing with housing staff in that state. Earlier this Spring I tried to get in contact with her to file the housing application, as she required at our last meeting, but she continually delayed talking with me over the phone in Florida for roughly two months.

In fact, they bounced around in my head and added to my anxiety, even as I was actually trying to focus on some mathematics.\n\nI was able to sit down and do some productive writing the next day because I had a good day with less anxiety. It wasn\u0027t because I just forced myself to focus. If anything, I was able to focus on writing because of a really excellent yoga practice the night before.\n\nI\u0027m already an overachiever.

The way you have been acting and reacting to things since the big Cymbalta increase is not normal. You need to call your psychiatrist first thing in the morning, explain to them your severe ups and downs and persistent anxiety since the change. They will fit you in tomorrow since you are an existing patient. Trust.me on this, you do not want to take any chances whatsoever on something that will effect your mood like this drug.\n\nWhile you are there, if you have been having any other new symptoms, they are trained to listen and help you get treatment for them. This is the time to have an honest conversation with your trained professional.\n\nI am worried that if things keep going the way they have been for the past few weeks, you might do something we would both regret. Cymbalta (and Chantix for smoking for that matter) have sometimes chemical side effects which you cannot control. You need the doctor to figure out how best to handle the moods you have been in.\n\nCall me later. Sally should be available for dinner and conversation.",

I need you to respect my decision not to be involved with her research group. Because of my own history with Christine, thinking about her or any of her projects is stressful, and I won\u0027t continue to have that source of stress in my life.\n\nWith the exception of our co-authored work on RNAStructViz, I will not discuss any projects happening within Christine\u0027s research group. I will also not discuss Christine herself or any interpersonal drama from the research group. Please don\u0027t bring these topics up.\n\nTo be clear, this also means that I will no longer be answering your questions about RNA or any of the projects I was involved with (except RNAStructViz). You and Christine will need to figure out how to communicate effectively around these types of questions.\n\nI do want to encourage you to find an alternate outlet for your frustrations regarding Christine. She is a lot to handle, and you do deserve support. But, for the sake of my own (physical and mental) health, I can\u0027t be that source of support for you.\n\nIf you have questions, let me know.\n\nAnna",

And what do I wake up to having slept all day to recover after classes? Another excessively long Hangouts *message* (rather than polite understanding chat in person) dropped on my head to chew me out...\n\nYou have always said it\u0027s no trouble if you are over there and I\u0027m feeling too sick to go. And presumptuous is a big unwarranted word for some thing that would take an extra 30 minutes to pick up coffee once we\u0027re out.\n\nScrew you. Take your hormonal need for bitching out on your therapist. We don\u0027t need to do anything together on Thursday. I will find my own way over to Trader Joe\u0027s sans the judgement.",

You are, after all, the one who chose to glare at me and call me \"rude\" for ordering a piece of cheesecake at the free pizza dinner I bought you right after I got out of the ER for a painful iv antibiotic treatment. Not because I didn\u0027t offer to buy you one too, but because there were no vegan options, so I should have to abstain too.\n\nSome people will whine at the suggestion that while we would have been out, I need cheap coffee from Walmart. Others will keep their mouth shut and try to be good friends anyway. Where do you fall?",

I hope you know well enough to keep our private personal conversations out of gossip at school.\n\nKeep seeing your therapist and psychiatrist. You are a total piece of work and need it moving forward. Good luck finishing your pH.D. I wish you well in publishing your first paper as a graduate student.
