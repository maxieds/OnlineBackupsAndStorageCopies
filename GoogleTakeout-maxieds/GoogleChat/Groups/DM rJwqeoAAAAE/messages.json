I have documented the extra time needed to prepare for my comp this year with the dean of students. I also feel it is a low shot for you to even go about communicating to be that it is \"inappropriate\" for me to question the behavioral ticks (or a$$hat tendencies thereof). If that is out of place, then how exactly should I in your view go about communicating my frustrations to you about not being taken seriously for legitimate illnesses at school?\n\n2) I have been dealing with a lot of issues and external pressures that you are only vaguely aware of. My stress, panic attack level, and general mental health is suffering for it. \n\nPlease keep me in the loop if there are any other under communicated issues that we should deal with now before I really get affected by all this bad treatment.
