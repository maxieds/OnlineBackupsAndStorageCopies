<b><code>WELCOME: Thank you for using and testing this Android application! 

A detailed man page and instructions for using the

Please note that the Chameleon Mini scripting features 
in the subtab are still under active development. They 
are not yet considered production ready. However, 
testers and early adopters are welcome to try things 
out at any rate.
