Dear students:

Happy New Year and welcome to Math 1552!  Our Canvas site is still a bit under construction, but we should have the syllabus uploaded soon.

All of our class sessions will be meeting synchronously at the scheduled times, beginning with your studio on Thursday.  So, please be sure to come to class!  We will be posting more information about joining the online classes on the "Pages" section of Canvas. 

In order to access our lectures and class resources, you will need to join our Microsoft Team.  Please use this code to join the team: 1l634i7

We'll be discussing the syllabus and course structure in detail on Friday, but if you have questions, or just want to drop in and say "hi", I will be holding a drop-in hour on Wednesday, January 13, from 1:30-2:30 PM on this BlueJeans link: https://bluejeans.com/797114518 (Links to an external site.)

I am looking forward to meeting all of you soon!

Best wishes,

======== Example: Math 1552, Summer 2021: ========

Dear Students,

Welcome to the start of the Summer 2021 semester of Math 1552, Integral Calculus! 

Our Canvas site is still a bit under construction, but we should have the syllabus uploaded soon. Please get into the habit of checking the Math 1552 Canvas site frequently as assignments, course materials like annotated lecture slides, section handouts, video recordings, schedule progress and other course related information will be updated regularly. All of our class sessions will be meeting synchronously at the scheduled times with our first lecture time starting this next Monday morning at 11AM.  Please be sure to come to class! 

You will need to install the BlueJeans application (link to external site -- https://www.bluejeans.com/downloads) on your computer, tablet or phone devices to participate in and watch the course lectures and studio sections in synchronous real time. The BlueJeans link for our lecture this summer is as follows: https://bluejeans.com/316778686/8893. Please see the Math 1552 announcements on the front page of Canvas to find the BlueJeans links for your studio sections (starting on Tuesday of this week at 11AM) and to find the links and times to visit office hours for the course staff.

We'll be discussing the syllabus and course structure in detail on Monday, and starting on the fundamentals of this course (the definite integral, Thomas section 4.8). If you have questions, or just want to drop in and say "hello", I will be holding my first drop-in office hour of the semester later in the day on Monday, May 17, from 1:30-2:30 PM at the following BlueJeans link: https://bluejeans.com/551825437.

I am looking forward to meeting all of you soon! Good luck with your first week of classes.

Best wishes,

Maxie Dion Schmidt
