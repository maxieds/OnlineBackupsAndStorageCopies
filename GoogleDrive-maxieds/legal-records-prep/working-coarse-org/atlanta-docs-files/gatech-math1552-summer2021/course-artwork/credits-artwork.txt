The artwork was adapted from various freely available sources of 
clipart and images available on Google Images. The final 
renditions of the headers I used to customize the title slides 
each week that are found in this directory were created using 
the GIMP (a.k.a., the open source Photoshop).

Please reuse them if you like the artwork I created. 
Otherwise, if posting these images elsewhere, assume a 
Creative Commons (CC) open source license for the composite images.
