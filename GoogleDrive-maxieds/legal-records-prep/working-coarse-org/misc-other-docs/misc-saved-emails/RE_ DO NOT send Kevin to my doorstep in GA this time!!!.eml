Dear Andrew Luke,

I changed my mind. If Kevin feels like going to GA and playing God of War with his Windows networks, or engaging in social engineering ruses to further his graduate education, I will not bother me at this point. Women appreciate momma's boys for good reason. We all chip in to fight societal inequities and the establishment, e.g., the norm of Old White Straight Men of a certain disposition, where and when we can.

Cheers,

Dr. Maxie D. Schmidt

I sent the following to the former president. Good luck, men ?



SUBJECT: Talk to "fake news" (CNN) for corroboration and evidence of Trumpian Era malfeasance



MESSAGE BODY (in PARTS):



Dear Former President Obama,



I am currently suffering from serotonin syndrome. The aftermath is very much like a prolonged concussion type brain injury. I should be fine in 3-5 weeks. The irresponsible medication combination that caused this is primarily due to prescriptions written for me by Dr. Shannon ("Ronald") Croft. He is an on-campus psychiatrist at GA Tech who quoted my F-Trump diatribes on GitHub (GH). In particular, he openly made fun of my being an ethically minded hacker that chooses to build things up rather than destroy them or bring them to the ground. Does US/GA State law call this actionable offense aggravated assault yet? The intent is clearly there.



Pardon the harsh rhetoric, but family genealogy suggests that I am Native American (Cherokee; 3-4 generations removed from a chief) and Russian (hacking is in my blood, so to speak). I told these people (neo-Nazis, white supremacists) to get the hell off my continent over things like this. But no one listens to a woman like me (anymore, it seems). Good luck earning the requisite hacker stripes in PART-II ;)

[ ... PAYLOAD (PART-II) ... ]



I live next door to CNN/Turner HQ on campus in Atlanta. We have a direct fiber optic line from them (I believe) that does not go through the satellites. Have you, and Miss Pelosi, considered filing a federal injunction to make CNN hand over live footage broadcast over the last few years? I do not have enough cash for a big hard drive DVR right now. Would it make a difference if I did?



I recall a few instances of live broadcasts I have witnessed on CNN now that I am unable to work, thinking over things, and ruminating. It seems like the right thing to do to mention this to a powerful former politician that dislikes Trump and his ilk clearly even more than I do. These incidents include the following:



(1) Live broadcast (cell phone stream?) footage of the insurrection this January. I recall seeing Trump and a general dressed in WWII era Nazi regalia. CNN reported that the VP narrowly escaped with his/her (family's) lives. Very little discourse as to why Pence would still want to run for office. Was this in reality Kamala/Doug Harris + secret service. This video was, to the best of my knowledge, not rebroadcast;



(2) Jared in front of an easy-to-spot blue screen (pre video editing that ensued) trying to claim the impossibility of peace in the Middle East due to his initiatives, right before the election. Americans are, as a whole, dumber than we should be. Did anyone else fall for this garbage?



(3) Biden giving his first press conference since being elected. He had beady, evil looking brown eyes. Was he on drugs? CNN pulled the broadcast minutes after I posted a (now responsibly removed) note on my F-Trump GH thread with an international audience to warn them about hacked satellite feeds, and to be wary accordingly.

Andrew,



I made a $225 non-tax-deductible donation in the name of Dr. Kevin Mitnick to Bend the Arc. The message contains the following:



I talked with BTA volunteer Jacob over text at (754)-219-9327. I expressed concern about cybersecurity initiatives and fighting white supremacists online. This donation is a meaningful integer statistic that I can give for now -- $225. I am making the donation in the name of Kevin Mitnick (mama's boy; nicer guy; and as in the federal witness for the prosecution in the case against Lucky225). Please see to it that his staff get a copy of this by emailing them at info@mitnicksecurity.com and CC to andrew.luke@mitnicksecurity.com.



There is an interesting back story. These people and their faux-US-fourth-reich insurrection antics via online computer systems hacking have to stop IMMEDIATELY:



Over the pandemic year 2019-2021, I was threatened online and in person by a neo-nazi bearing a black and red ray-traced swastika avatar. He wanted to crucify me as though I were Jesus, King of the Jews. I know who he and his sons are in real life by circumstances beyond my control. One of the last chat messages to this subhuman anti-clever pseudo-intellectual creton was to respond that "I have a pile of dead trolls on my desk" (as in Holocaust victims) and asked if he wanted to join them. To which he responded after a night of thought: "Nice trolls." I lost it at him in the chat. Something supernatural let me ironically ask to speak with the Anglo-Christian devil whereby I offered him my soul to bring down the fourth reich. A very surreal thing happened in that I went into a trance (I think) and began to type. After a while something shook and pushed my body and screamed "LIVE!". I stopped typing. Eventually this year I filed a FBI tip report about how this vile low life helped organize the January 6, 2021 US capitol riots and attempt at insurrection behind closed doors on Twitter. Emmanuel at the top of the notorious 2600 print magazine helped "Free Kevin" documentary style for years. If he is right about Kevin, then that Jewish man I facetiously called a large Jewish American penis (intentional double entendre) in a FBI report about Lucky is a __saint__ in my religion.



Please do good with my small donation this year. Thanks for all y'all do as usual. Keep it up! -- MDS



Please notify Kevin without incurring me another in-person social engineering ruse. It's enough to know that y'all care.



Maxie

<p class="x_x_MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;; color:black">I recall a few instances of live broadcasts I have witnessed on CNN now that I am unable to work, thinking over things, and ruminating. It seems like the right thing
 to do to mention this to a powerful former politician that dislikes Trump and his ilk clearly even more than I do. These incidents include the following:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt; color:black"></span></p>

<p class="x_x_MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;; color:black">(1) Live broadcast (cell phone stream?) footage of the insurrection this January. I recall seeing Trump and a general dressed in WWII era Nazi regalia. CNN reported
 that the VP narrowly escaped with his/her (family's) lives. Very little discourse as to why Pence would still want to run for office. Was this in reality Kamala/Doug Harris + secret service. This video was, to the best of my knowledge, not rebroadcast;

 right before the election. Americans are, as a whole, dumber than we should be. Did anyone else fall for this garbage?

 posted a (now responsibly removed) note on my F-Trump GH thread with an international audience to warn them about hacked satellite feeds, and to be wary accordingly.

<p class="x_x_MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Consolas; color:black">Over the pandemic year 2019-2021, I was threatened online and in person by a neo-nazi bearing a black and red ray-traced swastika avatar. He wanted to crucify me as though
 I were Jesus, King of the Jews. I know who he and his sons are in real life by circumstances beyond my control. One of the last chat messages to this subhuman anti-clever pseudo-intellectual creton was to respond that &quot;I have a pile of dead trolls on my desk&quot;
 (as in Holocaust victims) and asked if he wanted to join them. To which he responded after a night of thought: &quot;Nice trolls.&quot; I lost it at him in the chat. Something supernatural let me ironically ask to speak with the Anglo-Christian devil whereby I offered
 him my soul to bring down the fourth reich. A very surreal thing happened in that I went into a trance (I think) and began to type. After a while something shook and pushed my body and screamed &quot;LIVE!&quot;. I stopped typing. Eventually this year I filed a FBI
 tip report about how this vile low life helped organize the January 6, 2021 US capitol riots and attempt at insurrection behind closed doors on Twitter. Emmanuel at the top of the notorious 2600 print magazine helped &quot;Free Kevin&quot; documentary style for years.
 If he is right about Kevin, then that Jewish man I facetiously called a large Jewish American penis (intentional double entendre) in a FBI report about Lucky is a __saint__ in my religion.
