Directory with ipad screenshots taken at REAP in Pensacola of Chase online banking records. 
During this time, I called to have a number of fraudulent transactions disputed and 
refunded to my account. What is missing are the obviously modified websites and Chase online 
banking data (with wizards for home, auto and other loans) from the stolen MacBook after 
getting trapped in Yellowstone National Park in late October of 2022.
